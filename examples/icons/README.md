## Icon Navigation Demo
Multiple pages are created. 

An icon view as a column on the right is used for navigation.

Auto generated navigation tabs are suppressed here. 

## Refresh Info For Icons

The icons support now an "info" property. This is to add e.g. available updates on the referenced page.

Here it is configured to refresh the icons and one info every 15 sec, so open the page and keep watching. 
(This is just a starting point for you ;-)
