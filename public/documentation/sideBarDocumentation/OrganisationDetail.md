You can delete all the data that is filled using the field app. Also if you select to delete metadata, it'll delete all the forms and concept that you had created using web application.

**Please note that DELETE ALL DATA action is irreversible, so choose the options very carefully**

You can also enable `save draft` and `approval workflow` features from here.

`save draft`: Enabling this feature will enable saving the registration form automatically on every press of next button. All the drafts are available on the register page.

`approval workflow`: Enabling this will allow you to approve/reject all the forms filled by the field users. You'll need to create a [custom dashboard](#/appdesigner/dashboard) and also adjust the [privileges](#/admin/userGroups) accordingly.
